<h1>Introduction</h1>
The Makerere University Fraud System is aimed at decreasing the financial shortfalls in Makerere
University at large that results from a number of factors including; forgeries of tuition fees payment
receipts by private students. Thus, as a team, we developed a fraud system that stores the receipt
numbers for each payment made for each student to help academic registrars keep track of forged
receipts within the shortest time possible.
<h1>Implementation:</h1>
We implemented the system using four programming languages i.e; PHP, JAVASCRIPT, CSS and
HTML.
It is assumed that Makerere has 1000 private students each having a unique student number. They
are assumed to make installment payments of tuition fees in 10 months, thus 10 entries of receipt
numbers.
The registrar randomly selects any receipt from the 3 provided by the student, search for the receipt
in the system, if found, the system returns and he simply looks at left most for the student number to
confirm what is on the receipt.
We randomly generated an associative array that stores student numbers and their corresponding
receipt numbers. Thereafter we sorted the array using the various sort algorithms and compare their
running times. We also implemented the different data structures on the generated array as
elaborated in our code.
<h1>HOW OUR SYSTEM OPERATES:-</h1>
<strong>1.The interface/ Index/Home page:</strong></br>
First, any of our users should be able to see and interact with our homepage or what we refer to as
the index page, where the user can access a navigation bar which provides links to different pages
from which we implemented the system functionalities I.e Data structures, Sorting, Searching,
Recursion, and the Comparison page. These elements have drop down menus that are also links to
other pages.
The index page also has a blog section where a user can provide feedback to us and other users
about data structures topics and the fraud system at large. This is through clicking the read more
button. We have exported our database called blog.sql that stores the posted information from this
section
Also part of the index page is a search button that takes you to the search implementation page.
</br>
<strong>2. Search Implementation:</strong>
To implement the search functionality, we generated an associative array that stores both
student numbers and receipt numbers. We then saved this generated array in a text file so as we
don't regenerate the array every time the system runs. This is triggered by the generate button. We
then generated an array from the text file and worked with it to implement the searching. By default
the search button on the search.php file works using the binary search algorithm and it displays the
amount of time the algorithm takes to return a given value from the array.
As part of our implementation is a comparison page(comparisons.php)where we compare
the performance of the binary search and linear search algorithms by subjecting the generated array
to both algorithms. Their respective running time and results are also displayed. Therefore we
recommend that the system uses binary search because it is more faster and more efficient
especially considering the fact that Makerere university has a large number of students.
Depending on the binary search algorithm, a registrar can use approximately 3.521 seconds
to work on 500 students.</br>
<strong>3.COMPARISON OF THE PERFORMANCE OF SORTING ALGORITHMS:</strong>
Our system compares the performance of the following algorithms:- bubble sort, Quick sort, Merge
sort, selection sort and insertion sort. These algorithms are all subjected to the generated array and
their executing times shown. This is done on individual basis on every sort page I.e bubble.php,
quick.php, merge.php, selection.php and insertion.php but they are compared generally on the
comparisons page.</br>
Screen shot illustrating the comparison page:Screen shot illustrating the Merge sort algorithm sort:-
From various comparisons that we carried out on the performance of all the above algorithms, we
concluded that quick sort algorithm is the fastest of all. This is evident in the sample execution times in
seconds shown below:</br>
Quick Sort: 0.034674</br>
Merge sort: 0.073878</br>
Bubble sort: 0.296191</br>
Insertion sort: 0.329905</br>
Selection sort: 0.686942</br>
For a small sample of data insertion sort algorithm is the best alternative to use as evident from our test
data.</br>
<strong>5. DATA STRUCTURES:-</strong>
From the homepage, in the navigation bar, the data structures element can be accessed by the user.
It is from this terminal that we implement basic types of data structures on the generated array ie
stacks, queues, linked lists and priority queues.
We also carry out basic operations eg delete, insert, search etc that are performed on those
data structures using our array and in all cases produce output.6.RECURSION
We also implemented recursion by generating a pascalâ€™s triangle on pascal.php page. Our algorithm
is recursive in nature and runs in O(n2) . A user inputs the number of levels of the triangle that he
wants the algorithm to generate and the resultant Pascals triangle is displayed on the interface as
shown in the screen shot below:On the navigation bar is a link called recursion that takes you to recursion.php were we
implemented a function that computes the sum of positive integers given a value for n and using
test data the function is found to work perfectly. A user inputs the number of positive integers(n)
that whose sum he wants the algorithm to compute and the result the is displayed</br>
